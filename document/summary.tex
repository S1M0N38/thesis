Ostrogradsky's ghosts shouldn't be scaring. Nevertheless the study of higher
order theories should be approached with caution. Maximum attention must be paid
to the energy spectrum of the systems because it is the core problem of such
theories. If the energy spectrum is not bounded from below nor from above
is improbable that the corresponding Lagrangian can model a physical system.
In Section~\ref{section: classical higher derivative systems} has been shown a
method to fix this problem with the imposition of constraints. The unboundedness
of the energetic spectrum is also found in quantum systems as well (absence of
ground state). The upshot is that HD theories are not intrinsically sick but
should be investigated more deeply and not discard a priori.
