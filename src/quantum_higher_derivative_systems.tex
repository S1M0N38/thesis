In this section the quantum counterpart of the previous classical system will be
studied. In appendices are presented two way to go from the classical
lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism to the quantum mechanical ones:
\emph{Feynman path integrals} (\ref{appendix:path_integrals}) and
\emph{canonical quantization} (\ref{appendix:canonical_quantization}). These
procedures will be used to derive the Quantum Pais-Uhlenbeck (QPU) starting from
\eqref{eq:lagrangian_PU}. The quantum version of the Ostrogradsky theorem will
be proved and lastly more example of ghost-driven theories are given.
