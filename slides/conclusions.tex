\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Higher order Lagrangians emerge from field theories formulated in
      higher dimensional bulk. \vspace{0.5em}
    \item Most of higher order theories suffer of \emph{linear Ostrogradskian
      instability} and due to the consequences of \emph{Ostrogradsky Theorem}
      they have been discard a priori. \vspace{0.5em}
    \item One way to cure Ostrogradskian instability is by imposing
      constraints.
  \end{itemize} \vspace{1.0em}
  $\Rightarrow$ higher order theories should be investigated more
  deeply with particular attention to the energy spectrum.
